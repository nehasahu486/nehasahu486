- 💬Hello, World!
- 👋 I’m Neha, a final year PhD student at the Fungal Genomics and Evolution Laboratory, Biological Research Centre, Szeged, Hungary
- 👀 I study fungal genomes to understand their ecology, evolution, and interactions with other organisms
- 🎓 My PhD work is focussed on understanding the genomes of _Armillaria_ species, which are a group of devastating forest pathogens and wood decaying saprobes
- 💻 I use a combination of comparative phylogenomics and gene expression studies to get insights into wood decay strategies and plant-pathogen interactions
- 💞️ Apart from that, I like to making sense out of big data 🧬 and compiling data visualization methods 📊 
- 👩‍💻 Here you can find codes related to analyses pipelines and visualization methods that I use in my studies
